# CliAdoptPet

Welcome to adopt a pet CLI! This gem is used to search and review pets that are up for adoption based on your location. 


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cli_adopt_pet'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cli_adopt_pet

## Usage

Enter a valid zip code and choice of dog or cat. A set of pet profiles will appear showing an email for adoption and status availability.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
